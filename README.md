<h1 align="center">🏠 House Price Predictor</h1>
<p align="center">
  <em>My first real Machine Learning project — built from scratch with Python & Streamlit</em>
</p>

## 💡 About this Project

This is a simple AI-powered app that predicts the price of a house based on:

<ul>
  <li>🛏️ Number of bedrooms</li>
  <li>🛁 Number of bathrooms</li>
  <li>📐 Living area in square feet</li>
</ul>

It was built as my first Machine Learning project to help me learn how to:
- Read and clean real-world data
- Train a regression model using <strong>scikit-learn</strong>
- Build a web interface using <strong>Streamlit</strong>
- Deploy the final app online
